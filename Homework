4. What is the x64 equivalent to "push ebp" and "mov ebp, esp"?




5. What are the differences between "Microsoft x64 calling convention" and "System V AMD64 ABI calling convention"?




void myFunction(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
  //some code
 }
 
6. Upon entry to myFunction (above), what does the stack look like when using Microsoft x64 calling convention?
